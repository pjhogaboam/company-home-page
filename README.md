# company-home-page
Practice using flex-box on a mock business.

This project was to practice using flex-box to display a grid of images that flow responsively with the page. I made up a business that incorporates farming and cheese since I was staying in the Netherlands when I worked on this. This is the first home page that I built from scratch by myself. Not the prettiest but it is a start.
